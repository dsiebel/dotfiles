# dsiebel's dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles, configurations and installer scripts I use on any 
of my (non-server) machines.

## Installation

`make` list available commands

`make macos` for my Mac OS setup

`make linux-mint` for my Linux Mint setup

`make fzf` to install fzf on top. Key-bindings and auto-completion are enabled by default


## TODO
[] move installer scripts to subdirectory
[] extract kubernetes ppa install to dedicated installer
[] auto-discovery of package manager to use (apt, eopkg, brew, linuxbrew) + dedicated package lists
[] how to automatically install vscode user settings and extensions?
